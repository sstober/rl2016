# Assignments 12: Deep Belief Networks & Deep Boltzmann Machines

## Reading

In this reading assignment, we extend our focus on probablistic models with intractable posterior distributions p(h|v).

Please read [Deep Learning Book - Chapter 19: Approximate Inference](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/inference.html) for an overview on possible approaches. You can skip most of Section 19.4.1 as indicated in the text.

Then continue reading [Deep Learning Book - Chapter 20: Deep Generative Models](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/generative_models.html):

* 20.3 Deep Belief Networks

* 20.4 Deep Boltzmann Machines  
  (This is the most important section.)

Section 20.5 is optional and will not be covered in the course.

**Deadline for questions to be considered in class is January 21, 7am**. 
I will also try to accommodate things that come in later but I cannot make guarantees. The earlier you bring up questions, the better.

## Course Project

Like last week, we will spend about 50% of the time in class for discussing the reading assignments. This will leave less time for the course project. Therefore, if you would like to present and/or discuss progress on a specific aspect of the project, please prepare accordingly. Also, please send an **email with the topic and the approximate amount of time required until January 23, 10am**.
