    reading: 
    - optional: True,
      title: "Deep Learning Book - Part I: Applied Math and Machine Learning Basics"
      url: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
    objectives:
      - establish learning environment (active participation etc.)
      - reflect on personal goals, motivation and (prior) knowledge
      - make course goals explicit (and link them to personal goals)
      - anchor course topic within broader scope of machine learning and deep learning         
    activities: 
      - "general classroom setup: circle of chairs / round table"
      - "15min introductions: get to know each other (name, study background, semester etc.)"  
      - "15min explain course rationale, (global) learning objectives, grading mode,
        establish/sign 'class contract' (signing can be done offline, bring to next class)"
      - "5min assign class documenter role for today 
        (takes photos for short course blog entry and does 3min-recap in next lesson, rotates each time),
        if < 15 students, instructor takes this role for 1st class,
        documenters for remaining classes will be determined by doodle poll"
      - 5min explain learner blogs (example)
      - "20min collect expectations and prior experiences 
        (option: ball joint with cross-disciplinary pairs: 3 steps, 5min each),
        5min for taking notes afterwards,
        homework: write this down in learner blog"
      - "15min group work: active structuring of ML topics (given topics, mixed groups)"
      - "15min topic map (together), can optionally moved to next class"
    note: "TODO: more links to online lectures/talks on basics"

    assignment:
        - label: "Learn to swim"
          link: assignment1.html
          objectives:
            - "Get your feet wet!"
          activities: 
            - set up server accounts
            - learn to use the development environment
            - work through the intro tutorials for Theano and/or Tensorflow as well as Jupyter
    objectives:
      - "understand and be able to explain fundamental and crucial principles of deep learning 
      (MLP, forward/backward propagation and gradient descent)"
    
    activities: 
      - "3-minute recap 'Last episode of...' (pictures of active structuring results and topic map)"
      - 30min answering questions / discussion of MLP chapter,  
      - "15min in pairs: explain each other how learning with gradient descent and backpropagation 
      in a simple feedforward MLP works (option draw sketches)"
      - 10min answering questions from pairs
      - "20-30min demo/intro of the deep learning frameworks (preferably by students who have used them already, 
        These students will not have much to do anyway to prepare for this lecture and during assignment 1.)"

    note: Most of this lecture should be known from basic machine learning courses.

          objectives:
            - "practice using the deep learning toolkit with a given model and dataset
            (no model design necessary yet)"
            - understand different basic training extensions and parameters
            - understand basic plotting functions (monitoring channels)
            - learn to document research process and outcomes            
          activities: 
            - "given: a simple feedforward model and a small dataset"
            - train the model using stochastic gradient descent
            - monitor the learning progress using training extensions for printing and plotting
            - vary the training parameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate) 
              and compare the resulting learning curves.
            - write a short blog post about this (could be combined with a jupyter notebook)                    - document and discuss findings in a blog post (could be combined with a jupyter notebook)
