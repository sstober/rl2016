    assignment:
        - label: Basic MLP training
          link: assignment2.html
          objectives:
            "
            practice using the deep learning toolkit with a given model and dataset
            (no model design necessary)
            understand different basic training extensions and parameters
            understand basic plotting functions (monitoring channels)
            "
          activities: 
            "
            given a simple feedforward model and a small dataset,
            train the model using stochastic gradient descent,
            monitor the learning progress using training extensions for printing and plotting,
            vary the training parameters (e.g., batch size, learnin rate) 
            and compare the resulting learning curves
            "
    objectives:
      "
      understand and be able to exlain fundamental and crucial principles of deep learning 
      (MLP, forward/backward propagation and gradient descent)
      note: most of this should be known from basic machine learning courses
      "    
    activities: 
      "
      3-minute recap "Last episode of..." (pictures of active structuring results and topic map),   
      30min answering questions / discussion of MLP chapter,  
      15min in pairs: explain each other how learning with gradient descent and backpropagation 
      in a simple feedforward MLP works, 
      10min answering questions from pairs
      20-30min demo/intro of the deep learning frameworks (preferably by students who have used them already),
