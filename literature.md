# Literature
---------------------------------

The entire [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville is excellent and worth reading. In addition to the theory of various neural network architectures, it also has practical tips and pointers to a lot of the applied literature.

More literature will be listed for the individual lectures and in the Piazza forum.
