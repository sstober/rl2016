# Assignments 5: Autoencoders & Case Studies

## Basic Reading

Please start by reading the full [Deep Learning Book - Chapter 14: Autoencoders](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/autoencoders.html). 

Post your remarks, insights and open questions in your blog and in the forum! Help each other to make sure you are not getting stuck too long with some unresolved issue.

**Deadline for questions to be considered in class is November 19, 7am**. 
I will also try to accommodate things that come in later but I cannot make guarantees. The earlier you bring up questions, the better.


## Further Reading

* Masci et al. [Stacked Convolutional Auto-encoders for Hierarchical Feature Extraction](http://people.idsia.ch/~ciresan/data/icann2011.pdf)

* Zeiler & Fergus [Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901)

* Makhzani & Frey [Winner-Take-All Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2752)

## Case Study - Group Assignments

Please complete the group assigments as introduced in class, i.e.

* Implement and compile your network (no training!) using Tensorflow (optionally plus Keras) or Theano (optionally plus Blocks or Keras)!

* Test it on a randomly generated input!

* Compute the number of parameters!

* Visualize the computation graph of the output for each implementation!

* Prepare a 3-min presentation for next week!
